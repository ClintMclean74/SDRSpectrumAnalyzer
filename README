SDRSpectrumAnalyzer creates a spectrum analyzer from a RTL2832 based DVB dongle.

Usage
-----

Set the start and end frequency and step size, all in hertz. Then start recording data for either the first or second series.

Includes a waterfall that shows the change in strengths over time. This can be set to show just the strength of the frequencies themselves or the increase in the near signal frequencies strength (Series 2 less series 1).

The waterfall minimum and maximum values can also be set or allowed to auto adjust so that the strongest signal is always shown in red and the weakest in blue. The auto adjust values are calculated for the averaged frames graph.

Also, the total average strengths for the frequency ranges on the graphs or the selected zoomed in range for both series are shown. So the average strength of one area or frequency range can be compared with that of the other series.

These features facilitates the objective of this rtl sdr spectrum analyzer and that's of finding the frequencies being generated by a signal source, whether that's from a mobile phone, a bug or from the human body being generated from what is now known as electronic harassment.

The first series should be recorded reasonably far away from the signal source and the second closer.

The frequency strength of the signal source should be stronger when nearer the antenna. 

Other sources of frequencies such as television and radio should be essentially constant since they are a lot further away.

It's this that facilitates finding the frequency of a signal source.

The difference in the signal strengths can also be graphed and the 4 signals with the greatest increase in strength when near the antenna are labeled on the graph.

There's also now a leaderboard, that records the most likely signals until it's reset.

The average of the recorded signals is used since this has a significant effect on improving the clarity of the data.


This is the recommended usage for detecting a signal from yourself:

You place the antenna, the sdr dongle and your computer in some central area that you can walk around.

You first record a series of data, with yourself reasonably far from the antenna. 

Then you record the near series data, 8 times with yourself very near and at different angles to the antenna, so moving 45 degrees each time.

After each near series recording, you clear the data for the next near series.

The most likely signals will be stored on the leaderboard.

You don't clear the far series, that's being used to compare each of the near series to determine if the signals are stronger when you're near, which is what a reradiated signal would be.

You can repeat the process after the 8 near recordings, though. That is clear the far and near series then record another far series and the 8 near. The leaderboard will continue to keep track of the most likely signals until you reset it.

You do this because you don't yet know where such a signal is being broadcast from and you need to get the antenna between yourself and the transmitter, so that you reradiate the signal back onto the antenna, increasing it's strength.

Also, other signals will start transmitting or change in strength while you're recording, so you need to do it a few times, a reradiated signal will consistently be stronger when you're near and at the right angles, so it should inevitably show on the leaderboard.

So after you've done this, the 4 most likely signal frequencies will be on the leaderboard. 

You can then evaluate each of these, reducing the frequency range of the program so that it's faster in detecting the changes.

That is, you start from say 410 to 470 MHz and then after you've found the likely frequencies, you adjust it to within around a 1 MHz range of each frequency and you repeat the process. The frequency that you reradiate will be stronger when you're near and from a certain angle.

I have successfully detected a signal at a very specific frequency being emitted or reradiated from myself using this strategy.

The biologically resonant frequency range of the human mind is between 400 and 500 MHz, so you could find a reradiated signal there. 

Each of us have our own resonant frequency and these could be used to biologically affect us if someone broadcasts on it.

That is, you wouldn't need to be implanted.

Now you need to find out whether you're emitting or reradiating a signal.

Installation
------------

You need to have the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013 from Microsoft found here:

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784

Use the x86 version for 32 bit systems, even if you've got a 64 bit system, since the code is compiled for 32 bit.

It will work on 64 bit systems so just download vcredist_x86.exe


If you haven't already installed the dongle follow this guide here:
