Welcome to the RTL SDR spectrum analyzer for detecting frequencies that you're emitting or reradiating.

The QuickStart form will now be shown. On activating it the automated detection process will start.

Signal data will be processed for when you're near to the antenna and further away. Stronger signals
when near indicate that you're emitting or reradiating a signal.

The antenna should be placed near your computer, on your desk and extended.

Preferably a yagi should be used. It can be placed a little further away, pointing at where you stand or
sit at your computer.

When you're not using your computer move away from it, at least several meters and if you're using a
yagi, then also out of it's detection region.

There are thousands of signals to be evaluated and signals often change in strength themselves, so this
is a long process to detect those signals that are being emitted or reradiated from yourself.

However, this program automates most of that process.

So go about your day and it will analyse the signals for you.

A signal that is being reradiated or emitted from you should often be in the various leaderboards
and interesting signals lists and the program itself will let you know if it finds something interesting.

The idea is that through the process of analysing these signals, those that are being reradiated or emitted
from you will inevitably show on the leaderboard lists.
